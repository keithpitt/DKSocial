# DKSocial

DKSocial makes it easy to post to Twitter and Facebook using Objective-C blocks.
It is used in the apps written by [Mostly Disco](http://www.mostlydisco.com)

## Installation

Copy the files from "Classes" and "External" into to your project folder, and add them to your Xcode project.

Then define the following in your project somewhere:

    #define FB_ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY @"ID_GOES_HERE"
    #define TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY @"CONSUMER_KEY_HERE"
    #define TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET @"CONSUMER_SECRET_HERE"

## Usage

### DKFacebook

1. Follow the **Authentication and Authorization** instructions found at
   [here](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk)

2. Include [DKFacebook.h][] into your controller

3. Create a button on your interface that will enable posting to Facebook.

4. Once you've done that, paste the following code into your controller.
   Obviously you'll need to change some of the variable names to match what
   is in your controller.

        - (IBAction)facebookButtonPressed:(id)sender {

            [[DKFacebook shared] toggle:^(BOOL enabled) {
              self.facebookButton.selected = enabled;
            }];

        }

5. Then post a link using:

        // Post to Facebook if enabled
        if([[DKFacebook shared] isEnabled]) {

          [[DKFacebook shared] postLink:@"http://www.google.com" success:^{

            NSLog(@"Posting worked!");

          } error:^{

            NSLog(@"Posting to facebook failed.");

          }];

        }

### DKTwitter

1. Include [DKTwitter.h][] into your controller

2. Create a button on your interface that will enable posting to Twitter.

3. Once you've done that, paste the following code into your controller.
   Obviously you'll need to change some of the variable names to match what
   is in your controller.

        - (IBAction)twitterButtonPressed:(id)sender {

            [[DKTwitter shared] toggle:self block:^(BOOL enabled) {
              self.twitterButton.selected = enabled;
            }];

        }

4. Then post a tweet using:

        // Post to Twitter if enabled
        if([[DKTwitter shared] isEnabled]) {

          [[DKTwitter shared] postMessage:@"Tweeting like a boss" link:@"http://www.google.com" success:^{

            NSLog(@"Posting worked!");

          } error:^{

            NSLog(@"Posting to Twitter failed.");

          }];

        }
